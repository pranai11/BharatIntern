Internship at BharatIntern

Hello all,
    I am glad that i got an internship opportunity to work as an intern in the domain Machine Learning at BHARATINTERN. Here I will be doing tasks related to Machine Learning using python.
	During my internship, I have the chance to work on real-world Machine Learning projects and gain hands-on experience in the EDA, ML Algorithms and model development.
	Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task through data-driven experiences. It is divided into several categories, including: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning etc.

For the tasks we have used

**IDE:** Jupyter Notebook

**Datasets:** Kaggle

* House Price Prediction DataSet: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedafsal007/house-price-dataset-of-india
  
* Wine Quality Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009
      
# Task-1: House Price Prediction
   House price prediction is a crucial application of machine learning and data science in the real estate industry. It involves developing models that can estimate the market value of residential properties based on various features and historical data. Common machine learning techniques used for house price prediction include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting algorithms. These models learn from historical sales data and use it to make predictions on new, unseen properties.

In this task we have used various machine learning techniues like Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest. We got an accuracy of 81% for Random Forest algorithm and 76% for Linear Regression Technique. We used mean_absolute_error, mean_square_error and r2_score as performance measures. Hence task-1 has been successfully completed.

# Task-2: Wine Quality Prediction
   Wine quality prediction is a fascinating and practical application of machine learning and data analysis. It involves building models that can assess and predict the quality of wines based on various factors and features. It enhances the wine production process, enabling producers to maintain and improve the quality of their wines while catering to the diverse tastes of consumers.

In this task we have used various machine learning techniues like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms. For every model we almost get an accuracy of 50%. Here we applied them on two types of datasets. We get same results for both of them.We used mean_absolute_error, mean_square_error, root_mean_square_error and r2_score as performance measures. Visualized them using plots and heatmap. Hence task-2 has been successfully completed.
